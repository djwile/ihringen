# Ihringen
From 1810 to 1870, the Grand Duchy of Baden required local religious communities to keep vital records (births, marriages, deaths) of all their adherents. These records were recorded in Standesbücher, or Status Books, are available scanned online at the State Archives of Baden-Württemberg, with records from northern Baden kept at [Karlsruhe](https://www2.landesarchiv-bw.de/ofs21/olf/struktur.php?bestand=12390) and southern records kept at [Freiburg](https://www2.landesarchiv-bw.de/ofs21/olf/struktur.php?bestand=10028). Ihringen town records are in the [Breisach district](https://www2.landesarchiv-bw.de/ofs21/olf/struktur.php?bestand=10028&klassi=&anzeigeKlassi=003) within the Freiburg archive, books 486 to 495. 

Beginning in 2021, I transcribed the most important parts of the records of Ihringen's Jewish community into a table, and also included some metadata to aide in querying. I attempted to make the data maximally useful for genealogists. 

I place the data here to make it publicly available to all those interested.
