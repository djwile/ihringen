# Ihringen
From 1810 to 1870, the Grand Duchy of Baden required local religious communities to keep vital records (births, marriages, deaths) of all their adherents. These records were recorded in Standesbücher, or civil status registries, are available scanned online at the State Archives of Baden-Württemberg, with records from northern Baden kept at [Karlsruhe](https://www2.landesarchiv-bw.de/ofs21/olf/struktur.php?bestand=12390) and southern records kept at [Freiburg](https://www2.landesarchiv-bw.de/ofs21/olf/struktur.php?bestand=10028). Ihringen town records are in the [Breisach district](https://www2.landesarchiv-bw.de/ofs21/olf/struktur.php?bestand=10028&klassi=&anzeigeKlassi=003) within the Freiburg archive, books 486 to 495. Despite the requirement taking effect in 1810, Ihringen's Jewish records only begin in 1811.

At some point in 2021, I transcribed the most important parts of the records of Ihringen's Jewish community into an Excel spreadsheet, and also included some metadata to aid in querying. I attempted to make the data maximally useful for genealogists. 

I place the data here (in both .csv and .xlsx form) to make it publicly available to all those interested.

This repo also contains all code for the site [ihringenjewishrecords.org](https://ihringenjewishrecords.org). This site allows users to search the Ihringen Jewish data without needing to download or query it for themselves. 
This site also contains more in-depth information about the records, a detailed data dictionary, and transcriptions of some pre-1811 data.
